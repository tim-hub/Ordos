Solo learn is an app which is quite similar to Duolingo, the difference is that Solo Learn is for learning programming.

The course is not that difficult, not time consuming, but it is still good for preparing interview questions.

Based on my experience in New Zealand, there were not really hard questions during inteviewing, so this app is quite good in this case.

These are 2 certifications I got recently, and I am in top 5 for a while in NZ region!!!!!

One interesting staff is `Challenging`, but your weapon is `programming language`.
